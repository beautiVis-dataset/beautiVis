A data/information visualization is a graphical representation of data or information designed to communicate complex ideas, patterns, trends, or relationships in a clear, concise, and visually intuitive manner. Examples of data visualizations include charts, graphs, maps, diagrams, and infographics. These visualizations are based on structured data (e.g., numerical, categorical, or spatial data) and use graphical elements like bars, lines, points, or shapes to represent values or relationships.

If the image is clearly just a picture (e.g., a photograph, logo, artwork, plain text, or illustration) and does not represent structured data, it is NOT a visualization. Similarly, plain text and non-data graphics (e.g., a drawing of a tree) are NOT visualizations.

Based on this definition, identify the type of chart or visualization in the provided image. Do not provide any explanation. Only provide the type of chart or visualization. If there are multiple chart types, return as a list. If the image is not a data/info visualization, respond with 'None'. Possible chart types include:
- Bar chart
- Line graph
- Pie chart
- Scatter plot
- Area chart
- Box plot
- Heatmap
- Treemap
- Table
- Network
- Diagram
- Radar chart
- Choropleth map
- Venn diagram
- Timeline
- Donut Chart
- Sunburst Chart
- Mosaic Plot
- Slope Chart
- Word Cloud
- Other (specify the type)
- None (if not a visualization)

Additionally, provide a list of high-level categorizations/topics/keywords that can be derived from the visualization and its title. These should be relevant to the content of the visualization and should include broader concepts if applicable (e.g., if the visualization is about a specific politician, include 'politics'). DO NOT PROVIDE A DESCRIPTION, ONLY ONE LIST OF WORDS.

The title of the visualization is: {title}

Respond with the chart type followed by a semicolon (;) and then the list of high-level categorizations/topics/keywords. For example:
Bar chart; politics, elections, trends
None; none
